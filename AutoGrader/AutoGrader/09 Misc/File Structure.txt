Student directory:
 - Top level directory does not need to be named to a standard, represents an assignment.
 - Each folder within this directory should represent a single student and must be unique, all 
	 assignment files must be within this directory.
 - The grader will check all subfolders within the student directory to get any files for the assignment.

 Ex:
   ..\studentDirectoryA5
		\student_01
		\student_02
		\student_03
			\makefile
			\main.cpp
			\ClassA.cpp
			\subFolder
				\AnotherClass.cpp

Instructor directory:
 - The instuctor directory is the same format as the student directory except that the files are
	 directly within the specified folder.

  Ex:
   ..\instructorDirectoryA5
		\makefile
		\main.cpp
		\ClassA.cpp
		\subFolder
			\AnotherClass.cpp
